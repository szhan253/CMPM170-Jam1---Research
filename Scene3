+ "Open Your Eyes"

- I am in a desert this time. It seems like the area I am in is not super dry since there are still some desert plants around me. 

- I try to stand up and clean my clothes. 

- {items_get ? Fly: 
        There is something hard in my pocket. I take it out to check what is that. There is a golden key in my hand!
   }

- {items_get ? Bottle:
    I am not sure if there is going to be easy for finding water. I need to make sure I can survive in the desert. Thus, I'd better use a container to get some water with me. The bottle is still empty and there are some plants. Why not just get some water from those desert plants?
    }
    
+ Get Water from Surrounding Plants -> water
+ However, I have no idea whether those plants are eatable and do not want to kill the plants. So I decided to try to search for water around. -> no_water

== water
    ~  items_get += (Plants)
- I drink a little liquid I got from the plants. However, the plants are poisonous plants. I lost all feeling.

== no_water
- There is no water around. Sun shines on the ground and it is so hot. I lost all feelings because of dehydration.
