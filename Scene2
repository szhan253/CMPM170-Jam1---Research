- I look around to figure out where I am this time. There is some water falling down on my face. I am in a forest! There are all kinds of insects moving around me.

{Scene_1 && scene2_visited == 1: It seems like I have been here before. There is a black hole suddenly appears under me and I drop in there while thinking. -> MainLoop}

- "Ding~~ There is a task assigned to you."

- "Why is there someone speaking in my mind?"

- While thinking, there is a screen pops in front of me.

+ [Check the screen]

- {items_get ? Bottle:
        "You need to use the bottle to collect samples for research. 

    - else:
        "The critical information is missing. Please try to find the task on your trip.
        
  }
- You can check your bag to see what else you can use. Have a nice trip in the forest. Good Luck!"

- The system doesn't give me time to think. It closed by itself after it read all the words. I am still confused, but it seems like there is nothing else to do except follow the rules.

+ [Walk Follow the Trail]

- There is a golden dragonfly almost hit me.
